The project consists of the following elements: a. Constructing a bridge of about 1.29 km length and 22.10 meters width over Shitalaka river to become a double direction-road of asphalt road specifications with two-tracks in each direction.",210,Transport and Storage,,Implementation,2,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Bangladesh,"https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=FNEXBD0020100205e625000ba&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/index.php?ref=MjBfMDlfMjhfMTJfMV8yXzE0NTAxMg==, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/01/27/15795, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rhd.gov.bd/PublicProcurement/Short%20listing%20of%20Consultant%20againt%20RNIMP-1.asp?vcompid=93, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.sfd.gov.sa/cs/groups/public/documents/document/mdaw/mtyy/~edisp/121-document-162339.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)",5,"Saudi Fund for Development, Government Agency","Roads and Rails Directorate - Ministry of Transportation, Government Agency","Saudi Fund for Development, Government Agency",1,"Roads and Rails Directorate - Ministry of Transportation, Government Agency",1,Checked,1,ODA-like,2,Development,1,Active,1,"https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=FNEXBD0020100205e625000ba&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","168,750,000",SAR,1.02,0.27,"46,473,750","45,562,500",,,,31-Dec-13,1,Bangladesh,771,666,Bangladesh,BGD,BD,50,513,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,Concessional,,,,,15-09-01 12:57,Shitalakhya River,,1,Yes,5,8,1332540,Saudi Arabia,Saudi government provides 53.54 million USD for flyover construction in Bangladesh,2011,FALSE,"On February 7, 2011, the Bangladeshi government secured an amount of 3.73 billion TK (200 million Saudi Riyal) for a 8.25 km Moghbazar-Mouchak Flyover to improve traffic congestion. This project is cofinanced with SFD [53.54 million USD], the government exchequer [33.88 million USD], and the OPEC Fund for International (OFID) [28 million USD]. The total cost of the project is said to be about 7.73 billion TK (432 million Saudi Riyal). The project was originally planned to be finished by December 13. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasnia on February 15, 2013, and as of February 28, 2014, the project is 20% completed. News sources say expected completion is now 2015. The main objective of this project lies in supporting the infrastructure and improving the jammed traffic in the Capital, Dhaka. This shall be realized through the construction of three flyovers, two of which over the country's main intersections the first of them over Moka Bazar intersection and the second over Mootchak intersection as these two intersections are close enough to each other and suffer heavy traffic, whereas the third bridge shall connect both intersections. The length of these bridges reaches almost 8.25 Km, as they traverse two railways and eight road intersections. The project is formed of the following sections: a. Constructing 1800 meters flyover that traverses the intersection of Mokabazar and is formed of four tracks and two sidewalks. b. Constructing a flyover of two levels over Mootchak intersection, the first level is of 3157 meters length with four tracks, whereas the second level reaches a length of 430 meters with two tracks c. Constructing a bridge to connect both intersections, its length shall reach 1858 meters and shall be formed of four tracks and two sidewalks. d. Constructing 15 ramps between the different levels totaling to a length of almost 1000 meters e.

The Saudia Arabian government had already provided a loan for 81 million USD to complete the project in 2009, but under the Pakistan Peoples Party, the project faced several obstacles that raised the cost of the project far above initial projections. The project is also involved in a strategic claim on the Neelum River where India is currently constructing the Kishanganga Dam. The project aims to meet the increasing demand for electric power in Pakistan via the establishment of Neelum Jhelum hydropower station near to Muzaffarr Abad city. The project is concerned with transferring water from Neelum River through the divert canals that start in Nasiri district, 41 km to the East of Muzaffar Abad. The project is expected to reduce the dependence on the production of the highly-costing thermal energy; it shall also contribute to improve the environmental and economic circumstances and raise the region living standard in general. It's worth mentioning that the Fund had previously provided a loan to help constructing the station but given the increasing expenses and crucial need for further funding, the Fund has provided an additional loan to assist in the project completion. The project consists of the following sections: A. Construction of a 160 m long and 60 m high reinforced concrete dam over the Neelum River at the Nasiri district. Behind the dam, a lake is formed with a storage capacity of 10 million cubic meter of water which it allows benefitting of 3.80 million cubic meter of water in the peak times in order to cope with the need for electric power for about 4 hours daily. B. Construction of single and double canals with total length of about 48 Km to transfer water from the dam to the power station. C. Construction of an underground power generation station complex in Chater Class province about 22 km away from Muzaffar Abad city. The station total generation capacity is 969 mw and is linked to Jakar power station through a 500 kv double transmission line. D. Consultancy services including the provision of all services required for the preparation of detailed designs and tender documents in addition to supervising the project implementation.
